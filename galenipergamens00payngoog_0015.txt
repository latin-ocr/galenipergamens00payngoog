The Publishers are desimus us gaiuing informztion about the
printer, John Siberuh, before 1521, when he commenced to print in
Cambridge, and aster 1522 when he discentiuued print-ing there.
Herbert suggests that he rnay be the John Sibert, who was printing
at Lyous in 1498, and mentions a book os that date being in the
Cambridge Universify Library. But this book, Henrici Bouhic Dis-
tinctiones super libros quinque Decretalium, consists of two large
solio volumes, and the printer calls himself *Magister Johanhes
Siberti;’ both of which facts make ir unreasonable to identify him
with the plain Johannes siberch who printed little books at Cambridge
so many year: asterwards.
