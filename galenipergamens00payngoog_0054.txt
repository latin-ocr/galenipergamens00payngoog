experimmt. They led also inevitably to a study of Hippomtes,
a writer far more umystemade, and free from the vice of
formalism, whose sagacity and power os observation give his
works a nial freshness. Finally. the revival os the ancient
classica led to the revival also of the sciences on which modern
medidne rests, and which were destined to overthrow all the
dogmatic systems, viz. Anatomy and the knowledge of Drugs.

Bauer, speaking os the progress of anatomy in the 16th
oentury, attributes it to two chief causes, the revival of the
work os Galen, and the invention of printing. Not less did
Bou-my and Phannacology take a new departure from the

Itwould be out of place here to enter into any general
eatinnte os the value of Galen’s writings. They are os im-

have done more than dip into thern. But this massiveness and
bulk were perhaps even among the features which caused his
works to be held in such high estimation. They formed a vast
mcyclopaedia in which all the ancient medical lore was com-
pnsed. A very large part of the works even of Hippocrates
may be said to be contained in Galen, and many older
